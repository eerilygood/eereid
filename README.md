# What is eereid?
eereid is a minimalist Python library, allowing users to train and evaluate re-identification models with ease.

Built on tensorflow and developed as part of a research project at TU Dortmund University, the library aims to be a light-weight alternative to commonly used libraries for deep learning and re-identification in particular. The library allows you to easily use your own datasets and model. In doing so, you can tweak training parameters and evaluate your models in a breeze, even if you are not particularly familiar with deep learning.

# How can I install it?

On your preferred OS, make sure you are using python 3.8 or 3.9: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

Open up your preferred directory and clone this repository:

```git clone https://github.com/psorus/eereid.git```

Navigate to the installation directory and run install.sh in a terminal to install the required modules
