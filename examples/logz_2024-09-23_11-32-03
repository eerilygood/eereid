Haunting (Ensemble ghost) experiment, build from 4 ghosts.
    Dataset:
        MNIST data loader
    Distance:
        Euclidean distance is a measure of distance between two vectors. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two vectors. The formula is: sqrt(sum((a-b)^2))
    Submodel 1:
        Ghost ReID experiment
            Dataset:
                MNIST data loader
            Model:
                Creating a simple graph neural network model.
            Loss:
                Triplet loss with margin of 1.0. The formula is relu(D(a,p)-D(a,n)+margin).
            Distance:
                Euclidean distance is a measure of distance between two vectors. It is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between the two vectors. The formula is: sqrt(sum((a-b)^2))
            Preprocessings:
                Converts an image into a graph, by searching for for significant parts. The resulting graph will have 50 nodes.
                Reduces the fraction of samples used by factor 1. This is mostly useful for quickly debugging
